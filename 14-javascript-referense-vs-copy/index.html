    let age2 = age

    //불변성유지 안해도, 값이 유지된다. (string, number, bool만) 참조가 아닌 복사기 때문

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'lix'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(team)
    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players)
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // 배열은 복사가 아닌 참조다!


    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()
    // one way
    team2[2] = 'lean'
    console.log(team2, players)
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    team4 = [...players]
    tema5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    // and think we make a copy:
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const person2 = Object.assign({}, person, {phone: '000000-00000'})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const person3 = {
      ...person,
      phone: "00-000"
    }
    console.log(person3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const person4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
